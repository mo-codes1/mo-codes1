## Overview

A committed, hard-working tech enthusiast with an eagerness to learn new things, further enhanced by my education at the Makers Academy Bootcamp. Key concepts such as keeping to a strict Test Driven Development and being able to follow an Agile workflow. A team player who is well versed in working on large projects and producing ideas for continuous improvement, as well as taking on personal responsibilities when it comes to learning new material. 

## Introduction

I had some exposure to coding when it came to my degree. I have a masters in Electrical Engineering and I always knew it was a viable career path, but never really considered it. Being able to design things like websites or apps with nothing more than a keyboard, mouse and your imagination was a skill that I really wanted to learn.
