## Overview

A committed, hard-working tech enthusiast with an eagerness to learn new things, further enhanced by my education at the Makers Academy Bootcamp. Key concepts such as keeping to a strict Test Driven Development and being able to follow an Agile workflow. A team player who is well versed in working on large projects and producing ideas for continuous improvement, as well as taking on personal responsibilities when it comes to learning new material. 

## Introduction

I had some exposure to coding when it came to my degree. I have a masters in Electrical Engineering and I always knew it was a viable career path, but never really considered it. Being able to design things like websites or apps with nothing more than a keyboard, mouse and your imagination was a skill that I really wanted to learn.

The pandemic came around and I decided that I wanted to pick up coding again, and I really enjoyed to the point that I was starting to create little side projects. I knew to get a real foothold into the tech industry and gain some real insight into how working in tech would look like I would have to join a coding bootcamp. Makers Academy is highly selective of its bootcamp students so it was an honour to be selected for the October 2021 cohort. I completed a Ruby course on Code Academy and got stuck into Codewars katas which I'm still doing regularly to keep myself sharp during my job search. It's also really helped when it came to making sure I had the fundamentals on point because syntax aside without knowing what the code in front of you is doing coding can get really hard.
